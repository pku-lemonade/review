# ## Algorithm design and analysis
# Solution: an algorithm is a well-defined, finite sequence of steps that solves a specific problem or accomplishes a particular task. We focus on algorithms that can solving problems.

# ### ML Algorithms
# Soultion: ML algorithms are fundamental tools that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

# #### LLM Algorithm
# Solution: enable ai chat with human, some people think is the way to AGI.

# ##### LLM Alignment
# Solution: LLM alignment aims to make LLM outputs more consistent with user intent. Its challenges are ensuring safety, addressing multi-modal complexities, and balancing inference ability with alignment.
