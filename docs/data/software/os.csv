# ## Kernel design and implementation
# Focusing on the kernel design and implementation for general systems.


# ## Process and thread management
# Focusing on the process and thread management for general systems.


# ## Memory management
# Memory management is the basic of system design.

# ### Memory Partitioning
# Solution: efficiently and securely divide physical memory among multiple processes or systems
# Challenge: ensuring processes get enough memory without waste, while preventing interference and maintaining system performance and security.
