# ## Kernel design and implementation
# Solution: abstracting the underlying hardware and providing a secure, managed, and efficient environment for user-level applications to run concurrently and share system resources


# ## Process and thread management
# Solution: ensuring fair resource allocation, smooth multitasking, and proper coordination between processes and threads to maximize system performance and responsiveness.


# ## Memory management
# Memory management is the basic of system design.

# ### Memory Partitioning
# Solution: efficiently and securely divide physical memory among multiple processes or systems
# Challenge: ensuring processes get enough memory without waste, while preventing interference and maintaining system performance and security.

# ## Virtualization
# Solution: efficiently managing and isolating multiple virtual machines (VMs) or containers on a single physical machine, allowing them to share hardware resources securely and independently while maintaining performance and flexibility.


# ## Synchronization
# Solution: coordinating access to shared resources among multiple processes or threads to prevent conflicts, ensure data consistency, and avoid issues like race conditions, deadlocks, and resource starvation.
