# ## Photonic computing
# Solution: Uses light (photons) instead of electricity (electrons) to perform calculations and process information. It leverages the unique properties of light; such as its speed and parallelism; to achieve high-performance computing.

# ## Computational Sprinting
# Solution: Leverages chip's thermal budget to enable brief, massively parallel "sprints" on otherwise dark silicon, in order to dramatically accelerate transient workloads and improve application responsiveness.
