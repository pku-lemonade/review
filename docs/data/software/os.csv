# ## Virtualization
# Solution: efficiently managing and isolating multiple virtual machines (VMs) or containers on a single physical machine, allowing them to share hardware resources securely and independently while maintaining performance and flexibility.


# ## Synchronization
# Solution: coordinating access to shared resources among multiple processes or threads to prevent conflicts, ensure data consistency, and avoid issues like race conditions, deadlocks, and resource starvation.
